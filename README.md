GitHub Notes: \
things that i learned is how easy it is to make commits from vsCode. \
I also learned that I can open up a terminal and get an up to date code project just from a simple pull request. \
overall I have never used github so learining all of these new commands was great and extreamly useful.

css/simon css
- I liked how with media control we can exclude things got make it smoother for different displays.
- Using a flex box we can make different orientations 
- With a grid we can have better organization. 
- bootstrap makes it easy to have the css go straight into the HTML and when you know then it is easy to read
- when coding the simon css it was intersting to see how the class elemts relate to the css


startup html and css
- html can be reused and if the classes are the same then the css will apply to them
- with css you can tag mult. stamemts and get the right effect
- margin and padding are different and should experimeint with which works best for the project.
- div tags are important and useful if wanting a container.
